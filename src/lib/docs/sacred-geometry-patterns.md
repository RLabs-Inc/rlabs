## Mathematical Principles

Each pattern utilizes one or more of the following mathematical principles:

1. **Golden Ratio (φ)**: 1.618033988749895

   - Used in spiral formations
   - Natural growth patterns
   - Divine proportions

2. **Sacred Angles**:

   - 19.47° (Tetrahedral angle)
   - 23.5° (Earth's axial tilt)
   - 51.43° (Great Pyramid angle)
   - 72° (Pentagon angle)
   - 137.5° (Golden angle)

3. **Sacred Numbers**:

   - Fibonacci sequence
   - Pi (π)
   - Euler's number (e)
   - Square roots of 2, 3, and 5

4. **Wave Functions**:

   - Sine and cosine relationships
   - Standing wave patterns
   - Harmonic resonance

5. **Geometric Transformations**:
   - Rotations
   - Reflections
   - Scaling
   - Projections

## Implementation Details

Each pattern is implemented as a function that takes a base hue (0-360) and returns an array of angles. These angles are used to generate colors that are harmoniously related to the base hue through sacred geometric principles.

Example structure:

```typescript
function getPatternName(baseHue: number): number[] {
  const angles: number[] = [];
  const phi = 1.618033988749895;

  // Pattern-specific calculations

  return angles;
}
```

## Usage in Color Schemes

The patterns can be used to generate color schemes by:

1. Selecting a base hue
2. Applying a sacred geometry pattern
3. Using the resulting angles to create related colors
4. Optionally adjusting saturation and lightness
